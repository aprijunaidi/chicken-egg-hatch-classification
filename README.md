![ayam-telur-menetas](https://github.com/aprijunaidi/chicken-egg-hatch-classification/assets/7279471/783be8fa-a03c-4d88-8516-e2355d4f5521)

The following is the programme code for image classification, which consists of three classes: eggs, chicks, and hatched eggs.

Library that use in code :
- os
- matplotlib
- tensorflow
- keras
- numpy

I use this code to support my paper published in IEEE with the following link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9588815. The paper is entitled *Overfitting Problem in Images Classification for Egg Incubator Using Convolutional Neural Network*.

If you need the dataset in this research, please get in touch with me at apri.junaidi@gmail.com

The other paper was published with this dataset :

IEEE : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9530826 : *Image Classification for Egg Incubator using Transfer Learning of VGG16 and VGG19*

Springer : https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-1804-9_7 *Image Classification for Egg Incubator Using Transfer Learning VGG16 and InceptionV3*
