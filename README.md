# chicken-egg-hatch-classification

The following is the programme code for image classification consisting of three classes: eggs, chicks and hatched eggs.

I use this code to support my paper published in IEEE with the following link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9588815, the paper is entitled Overfitting Problem in Images Classification for Egg Incubator Using Convolutional Neural Network.
